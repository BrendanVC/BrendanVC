With a deeply eager and driven mindset on self-education and skills diversification, my journey throughout software development and electronics is grounded within a passion for mechatronics, IoT, AI, and the usual joys of engineering.

I strongly believe that remaining consistently focused in both self-driven and collaborative learning. Engaging in diverse projects, creative problem solving and maintaining a proactive approach to developing new skills is my system of choice to succeeding in my desire to broadly diversify myself in the fields of computer science and beyond. 
Personally, I am inspired to utilise my passions, discipline and creativity for the sake of improving the quality of life and work-life balance for all, especially those who are at times excluded from the technology curve.
